P2ABC Docker
============

This file contains instructions on how to use the P2ABC docker files.

**NOTE** that it makes no sense to deploy any single component of P2ABC on its own; they only make sense when deployed together, and when deployed on different machines.

* [Read](../README.md) what P2ABC is all about. Also look at the [installation guide](../Documentation/zhaw/installation-guide.md) and [user guide](../Documentation/zhaw/users-guide.md).

* Decide on an infrastructure for the issuer and verifier.

* Map and configure the issuer's configuration files (web.xml, context.xml) according to the [installation guide](../Documentation/zhaw/installation-guide.md).

* Map and configure the verifier's configuration files (web.xml, context.xml) according to the [installation guide](../Documentation/zhaw/installation-guide.md).

* Map and configure the user's configuration files (web.xml, context.xml) according to the [installation guide](../Documentation/zhaw/installation-guide.md).

* Finally, run issuer, verifier, and user according to to the [user guide](../docs/user-guide.md).
