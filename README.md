===============

The code base for the GEri came from IBM's earlier GEri. In particular, this GEri uses the previous GEri's [architecture](https://github.com/p2abcengine/p2abcengine/wiki/Architecture). The specification of the p2abcengine have been done as part of the 
[ABC4Trust](https://www.abc4trust.eu) project.  

Code and documentation available here, where it is not by ZHAW, is by [Alexandra Institute](http://www.alexandra.dk/), [Miracle](https://http://www.miracleas.dk), and [IBM Research-Zurich](http://www.zurich.ibm.com) with support from the [ABC4Trust](https://www.abc4trust.eu), [FI-ware](https://www.fi-ware.eu),  [FutureID](https://www.futureid.eu),
